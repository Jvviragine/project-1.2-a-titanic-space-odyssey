  For Phase 2, our goal was to improve upon the Physics Engine from phase 1 that simulated the Solar System. In connection to this, we planned a two-year manned flight from Earth to Titan, one of Saturn's moons, and back. To this end, we use various solvers to simulate the solar system as well as the rocket's path and pass that onto a 2D graphical representation. Additionally, mid-flight corrections can be made via thrusters, the fuel consumption of which is calculated with help of simplified formulas.
