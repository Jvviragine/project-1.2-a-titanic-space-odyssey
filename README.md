  For Phase 3, our goal was to improve upon the trip simulator and calculator from phase 2 that simulated the journey to Titan. After this one-year manned flight from Earth to Titan, one of Saturn's moons, we then attempt to enter orbit and land on its surface successfully, with random wind effects and all. To this end, we use implemented two different controller types and once in orbit, use those to land safely on a designated point and pass that onto a 2D graphical representation.
